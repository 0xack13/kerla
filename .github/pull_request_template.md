Contributor Guidelines

First of all, thank you for submitting a pull request! To improve the quality please
follow the following instructions.

a) The PR title will be the commit message. Describe your changes briefly and
   use the present tense, without a trailing full stop:

   BAD:  "Fixed a bug."
   GOOD: "virtio-net: Fix an off-by-one error"

b) Prefer using `#123` over `ISSUE-123` to reference an issue or a PR.
c) Address compiler warnings (or add `#[allow(...)]`) before submitting the PR.

Please feel free to remove this comment.
